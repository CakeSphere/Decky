1,Blotterhead,{w}{u}{r},,2017-07-28,"Great card advantage with a lot of control. Chuck out what you don't need and get to what you do need quickly. Don't be afraid to counter things early, you want to lock down the board.

If you're successful in locking down the board, Fevered Visions will pretty much win it for you. Kill creatures with Lightning Axe and Fiery Temper . (9 out of the 10 most played creatures in Standard right now have a toughness of under 3, and that doesn't even include Smuggler's Copter and Fleetwheel Cruiser. See MTGGoldfish.)

Swing with Wandering Fumarole, refuel your hand with Bedlam Reveler or toss it with Nahiri's Wrath for some major damage against both creatures and planeswalkers. Collective Defiance will also do the trick.

DO NOT FORGET: You can change Wandering Fumarole's zero ability at any time. If you attack as a 4/1, and your opponent throws down a Galvanic Bombardment on the stack for three damage, you just switch it back to a 1/4.

Chandra, Torch of Defiance is best used with its ramp ability, and is practically a two drop on turn four. Drop a Chandra, Torch of Defiance AND a Fevered Visions on turn five. You'll hit your land drops with the card advantage from Cathartic Reunion and the Visions.

Here's the fun part: drop Combustible Gearhulk. You're either going to gain massive card advantage or do massive damage. If you can keep it alive (not too hard) until the next turn, drop Saheeli's Artistry to make TWO copies of Combustible Gearhulk.

Remember to choose BOTH ;-) Aren't enter the battlefield effects just the best? Since your opponent will probably choose draw, you'll have exactly what you need in-hand to finish them off.

And that's how you win.",Standard,417822,Standard,11,main,maybe,"Jeskai Fog",side,"Control, Discard, Izzet",2017-11-28

Developmental. Suggestions are always welcome just try to keep it civil. PLEASE LOOK OVER COMMENTS BEFORE MAKING SUGGESTIONS. Most of the stuff that could work in this deck has likely already been covered as to why I am or am not running it.

Proud to announce that as of 11/11/17 the deck is #2 rank on the site. Thanks to everyone who upvoted and commented

Will be updating for spoilers from Rivals of Ixalan. So far with new legendary enchantment Storm the Vault leaked it looks like things could get out of hand quick (can someone say bigger Torment of Hailfire?).",Standard,435235,Standard,0,main,maybe,"Treasure Production Control",side,"Combo, Competitive, Control, Cruel Control, U/B (Dimir)",2017-11-28

This is a deck of pure hatred. This is not a deck concerned with ""goldfishing"", although it can achieve explosive wins and a fast clock out of nowhere. Almost every card in the deck is there because it hates, neutralizes, or completely obliviates other decks and strategies in the format.

There are creatures in the deck, and the deck wins by attacking through creatures. Yet that's not the focus here. The focus is Mox Diamond and Chalice of the Void for 1 on the play. The focus is having both players in madness with a Liliana of the Veil on the field. Or the focus in a different game could be using Life from the Loam, Knight of the Reliquary, and Wasteland to lock your opponent in the abyss of mana screw.

This deck won't make sense on paper to many people, certainly to most who don't play Legacy. The idea here is that you're playing a ""fair deck"" in a wildly unfair format. There's no key combo that they can just kill with a certain hate card of their own. If they stop Thespian's Stage and Dark Depths and you can't find that Life from the Loam, just beat them to death with the knight. This idea may seem unrealistic in comparison to decks like Charbelcher and Leylines, but I've practiced it enough that I can guarantee the percentages are there to win. Combo decks that are ""too good"" and consistent for this deck to beat are banned in Legacy, like Oath of Druids. Delver and Miracles decks suffer on the other end, slowly drowning to Chalice of the Void on 1 the same way a Lotus Petal + Lion's Eye Diamond deck dies to a Chalice for 0.

Legacy is such a crazy format that the idea of just playing fair is unorthodox. And to be fair, ""just playing fair"" in this format entails maindecking a bunch of cards that would be bad in other formats like Standard, such as Gaddock Teeg. But then again, if one of those normie decks were to challenge this deck, it wouldn't stand a chance in the first place. Legacy is all about the metagame, and the Abzan shard has access to an extremely wide range of hate. A fair deck in an unfair world.
