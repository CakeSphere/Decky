After combat damage is dealt, Quietus Spike looks at that player's life total (which is the same as the team's life total) when determining how much life the team will lose, which basically means the team's life total is halved. Here's an example of the math: The team has 19 life, so the player has 19 life. Quietus Spike causes the team to lose 10 life (19 divided by 2, rounded up). The team's life total becomes 9 (19 minus 10)."}],"subtypes":["Equipment"],"text":"Equipped creature has deathtouch.\nWhenever equipped creature deals combat damage to a player, that player loses half his or her life, rounded up.\nEquip {3}","type":"Artifact — Equipment","types":["Artifact"]},{"artist":"Brian Snõddy","cmc":1,"flavor":"The passing of the sai presages the end of the old clan and the ascent of the new.","foreignNames":[{"language":"French","name":"Sai du shinobi","multiverseid":287707},{"language":"German","name":"Sai des Shinobis","multiverseid":287863},{"language":"Italian","name":"Sai dello Shinobi","multiverseid":288175},{"language":"Japanese","name":"忍びの釵","multiverseid":288331},{"language":"Spanish","name":"Sai de los shinobi","multiverseid":288019}],"id":"c750d029bae5b805251ac5b10e66f187ecde2cfb","imageName":"sai of the shinobi","layout":"normal","legalities":[{"format":"Commander","legality":"Legal"},{"format":"Legacy","legality":"Legal"},{"format":"Vintage","legality":"Legal"}],"manaCost":"{1}","mciNumber":"113","multiverseid":270731,"name":"Sai of the Shinobi","number":"113","originalText":"Equipped creature gets +1/+1.\nWhenever a creature enters the battlefield under your control, you may attach Sai of the Shinobi to it.\nEquip {2}","originalType":"Artifact — Equipment","printings":["PC2","PCA"],"rarity":"Uncommon","rulings":[{"date":"2012-06-01","text":"If you choose not to attach Sai of the Shinobi to the creature, or if you can't (perhaps because the creature has protection from artifacts or has left the battlefield by the time the trigger resolves), Sai of the Shinobi doesn't move."}],"subtypes":["Equipment"],"text":"Equipped creature gets +1/+1.\nWhenever a creature enters the battlefield under your control, you may attach Sai of the Shinobi to it.\nEquip {2}","type":"Artifact — Equipment","types":["Artifact"]},{"artist":"Ron Spears","cmc":5,"flavor":"The golems of the ancient Thran still draw power in ways that baffle the artificers of today.","foreignNames":[{"language":"French","name":"Golem thran","multiverseid":287752},{"language":"German","name":"Thran-Golem","multiverseid":287908},{"language":"Italian","name":"Golem Thran","multiverseid":288220},{"language":"Japanese","name":"スランのゴーレム","multiverseid":288376},{"language":"Spanish","name":"Gólem thran","multiverseid":288064}],"id":"c3eb09e5c61ac87778128f4cf8733bc443c131b3","imageName":"thran golem","layout":"normal","legalities":[{"format":"Commander","legality":"Legal"},{"format":"Legacy","legality":"Legal"},{"format":"Modern","legality":"Legal"},{"format":"Urza Block","legality":"Legal"},{"format":"Vintage","legality":"Legal"}],"manaCost":"{5}","mciNumber":"114","multiverseid":271173,"name":"Thran Golem","number":"114","originalText":"As long as Thran Golem is enchanted, it gets +2/+2 and has flying, first strike, and trample.","originalType":"Artifact Creature — Golem","power":"3","printings":["UDS","9ED","M12","PC2","PCA"],"rarity":"Uncommon","subtypes":["Golem"],"text":"As long as Thran Golem is enchanted, it gets +2/+2 and has flying, first strike, and trample.","toughness":"3","type":"Artifact Creature — Golem","types":["Artifact","Creature"]},{"artist":"Daren Bader","cmc":3,"flavor":"Such cloaks are in high demand both by assassins and by those who fear them.","foreignNames":[{"language":"French","name":"Cape de frémisoie","multiverseid":287774},{"language":"German","name":"Mantel aus Flüsterseide","multiverseid":287930},{"language":"Italian","name":"Manto Setabisbiglio","multiverseid":288242},{"language":"Japanese","name":"囁き絹の外套","multiverseid":288398},{"language":"Spanish","name":"Manto de sedasusurrante","multiverseid":288086}],"id":"4eb6450b99ffb493f5b5f405c73847f8a4b08de1","imageName":"whispersilk cloak","layout":"normal","legalities":[{"format":"Commander","legality":"Legal"},{"format":"Legacy","legality":"Legal"},{"format":"Mirrodin Block","legality":"Legal"},{"format":"Modern","legality":"Legal"},{"format":"Vintage","legality":"Legal"}],"manaCost":"{3}","mciNumber":"115","multiverseid":271198,"name":"Whispersilk Cloak","number":"115","originalText":"Equipped creature is unblockable and has shroud.\nEquip {2}","originalType":"Artifact — Equipment","printings":["DST","10E","M10","DDE","M11","PC2","C16","PCA"],"rarity":"Uncommon","subtypes":["Equipment"],"text":"Equipped creature can't be blocked and has shroud.
